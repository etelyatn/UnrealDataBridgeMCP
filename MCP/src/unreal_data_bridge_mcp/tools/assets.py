        Searches the Asset Registry for matching assets. Use this to find assets
        when you don't know their exact path, or to explore what content exists
        in a particular directory or of a particular type.

        Args:
            query: Text to search for in asset names (case-insensitive substring match).
                   Leave empty to match all assets (use with class_filter or path_filter).
            class_filter: Optional class name to filter by (e.g., 'UDataTable', 'UTexture2D',
                          'UMaterialInstance'). Only returns assets of this class or its subclasses.
            path_filter: Optional prefix filter for asset paths (e.g., '/Game/Ripper/Products/').
                         Only returns assets whose path starts with this prefix.
            limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 50, max: 500).

              - name: Asset name

              - class_name: UClass name
